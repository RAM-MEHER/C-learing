1.Algorithm which is used to find a KEY in a sorted data.
2.Binary search only works on sorted data(Ascending of Ddecending).
                                                             //Algorithm for find a KEY in a array:
step 1: Take two variables LOW and HIGH.
step 2: Set LOW to 0 and HIGH to length - 1.
step 3: Run a loop as long as LOW <= HIGH.
   step 4:Compute a value called MID = (LOW + HIGH) / 2.
   step 5: 
             case i: If A[MID] == KEY , return MID.
             case ii: If A[MID] > KEY , then set HIGH to MID - 1.
             case iii: If A[MID] < KEY , then set LOW to MID + 1.
